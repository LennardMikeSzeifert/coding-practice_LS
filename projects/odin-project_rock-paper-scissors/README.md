# Project #3: Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project demonstrates my progress in learning JavaScript by building a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

The objective is to create a simple game where the user plays against the computer, with all interactions handled via the console (no user interface for now).

Key Focus Areas:

- Applying core JavaScript concepts

- Practicing problem-solving and pseudocode planning

- Committing early and often using Conventional Commits

- Writing clean, well-documented code

# UI-update #3.1 Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project demonstrates my progress in learning **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** by updating the **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game.

The game allows the user to play directly through an interactive **user interface**, replacing the previous console-based version.

---

## Objective

Create a simple browser game where the player competes against the computer.  
The game logic is handled in JavaScript, while the user interacts via buttons and sees live score updates on the screen.

---

## Key Focus Areas

- Applying **core JavaScript concepts** like functions, conditionals, and DOM manipulation
- Practicing **problem-solving** and **code refactoring** for readability
- Building a **responsive user interface** using **HTML** and **CSS**
- Updating the game flow from a **console-only version** to an **interactive UI**
- Managing project versions and workflow with **Git branching and merging**
- Committing early and often following **Conventional Commits**

---

## Features

- Three clickable buttons for the player’s choice: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**
- A **live score display** for both player and computer
- A **round status message** showing the result of each round
- An **end game message** announcing the winner once one player reaches 5 points
- Automatic **score reset** after the game finishes

---

## Future Improvements

- Add animations or sound effects for wins/losses
- Implement a restart button instead of auto-reset
- Improve overall layout and accessibility
- Add a “best of 5 / 10” mode selector

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structure
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – for game logic and DOM interactions
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and collaboration

---

## Learning Highlights

- Understanding how to connect **JavaScript logic** with **UI elements**
- Using **event listeners** for user interactions
- Learning to **separate concerns** — keeping logic, structure, and style organized
- Practicing **branching and merging** in Git for safe experimentation

---

## Summary

This project marks an important milestone — transitioning from console-based programs to **interactive browser applications**.  
It demonstrates not only JavaScript logic but also an understanding of how to connect code, visuals, and user experience.
