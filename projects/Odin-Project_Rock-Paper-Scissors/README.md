Project #3: Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project demonstrates my progress in learning JavaScript by building a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

The objective is to create a simple game where the user plays against the computer, with all interactions handled via the console (no user interface for now).

Key Focus Areas:

- Applying core JavaScript concepts

- Practicing problem-solving and pseudocode planning

- Committing early and often using Conventional Commits

- Writing clean, well-documented code
