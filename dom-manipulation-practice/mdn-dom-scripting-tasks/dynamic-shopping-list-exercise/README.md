Creating a dynamic shopping list
In this exercise we want you to build a dynamic shopping list that allows you to add items using a form input and button. When you add enter an item and press the button:

The item should appear in the list.
Each item should be given a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list.
The input should be emptied and focused, ready for you to enter another item.
